# Fuego Impact Study

The fuego-impact-study repository serves as a collaborative platform for analyzing the geological processes, environmental consequences, and societal impacts of Volcán de Fuego. This project aims to compile historical eruption data, assess socio-economic effects on infrastructure and regional economy, and document ecological consequences of volcanic activity. By integrating multidisciplinary data and analyses, the repository provides a comprehensive case study for researchers, policymakers, and communities affected by volcanic hazards.

## Project Structure

- `data/` – Directory containing historical eruption data.
  - `eruption_timeline.md` – Timeline of five major historical eruptions with year, Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI), and a brief summary of primary impacts.
- `socio-economic_impact.md` – Analysis of effects on infrastructure (e.g., Pan‑American Highway), transportation, agriculture, tourism, and the regional economy.
- `ecological_effects.md` – Analysis of the impact of volcanic ash and gases on soil composition, water sources, and native flora and fauna in the region surrounding Fuego.
