# Historical Eruption Timeline of Volcán de Fuego

This document lists five major historical eruptions of Volcán de Fuego, Guatemala, with year, Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI), and a brief summary of primary impacts.

## 1974
- **VEI**: 3
- **Impact**: Pyroclastic flows and lava flows descended the southern flanks, destroying agricultural land and causing temporary evacuations.

## 1999
- **VEI**: 2
- **Impact**: Moderate explosive activity produced ash columns up to 5 km height, leading to widespread ashfall affecting communities east of the volcano.

## 2002
- **VEI**: 2
- **Impact**: Effusive eruption with lava flows extending 2 km down the Ceniza drainage, accompanied by frequent strombolian explosions.

## 2018
- **VEI**: 4
- **Impact**: Catastrophic pyroclastic flows swept through the communities of San Miguel Los Lotes and El Rodeo, resulting in over 190 fatalities and massive destruction of infrastructure.
